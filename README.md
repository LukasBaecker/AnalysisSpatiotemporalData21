# AnalysisSpatiotemporalData21
This repository contains our results from the course "Analysis of Spatio-Temporal Data" held by Edzer Pebesma in the wintersemester 2020/21 at WWU MÃ¼nster.

In this project we analysed a given area of Amazon rainforest and detected deforested areas. 
It meant to be a project for having an insight in spatio-temporal data analysis and therefore we tried some different methods keeping in mind that we're just scratching the surface of spatio-temporal anaylsis.
